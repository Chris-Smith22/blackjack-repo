# Blackjack Strategy Performance Tracker and Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Blackjack Strategy Performance Tracker and Game** project! This project aims to compare the effectiveness of various Blackjack strategies in reducing the House Edge. Different strategies, such as Basic Strategy, card counting, random play, and imitating the dealer, will be implemented and their performances tracked over a given number of games.

## Project Overview
The project involves creating a Blackjack simulation program that allows you to test and compare different strategies. Players can choose from various strategies and play a specified number of games. Additionally, users have the option to play the game themselves in a heads-up match against the dealer, with options to play solo, with other users, or against computer-controlled players using different strategies.

The project includes the following main components:

- **Blackjack Game Logic**: The core game logic of Blackjack, including card dealing, player actions, dealer actions, scoring, and determining the winner.
- **Strategy Implementations**: Implementations of different Blackjack strategies, such as Basic Strategy, card counting, random play, and imitating the dealer.
- **User Gameplay**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to play Blackjack themselves, either in a heads-up match against the dealer or in multiplayer mode with other users and bots.
- **Performance Tracking**: A system to track the performance of each strategy over a specified number of games.
- **Spreadsheet and Graphs (Work In Progress)**: A feature to export strategy performance data to a spreadsheet and plot graphs to visualize the data.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the main program file: `main.py`.
4. Modify settings like the number of games to play, strategy to use, and any other parameters.
5. Run the program to simulate Blackjack games, observe strategy performance, or play the game yourself.

## Usage
1. Launch the program using your preferred Python interpreter.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a strategy, specify the number of games to play, and any other relevant options.
3. If you choose to play the game yourself, enjoy a game of Blackjack in a heads-up match against the dealer or in multiplayer mode.
4. The program will simulate the specified number of games using the chosen strategy and display the results.
5. Note: The spreadsheet and graph features are still in development.
