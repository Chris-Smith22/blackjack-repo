# Blackjack Strategy Performance Tracker and Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Blackjack Strategy Performance Tracker and Game** project! This project aims to compare the effectiveness of various Blackjack strategies in reducing House Edge. Different strategies, such as Basic Strategy, card counting, random play, and imitating the dealer, will be implemented and their performances tracked over a given number of games.

## Project Overview
The project involves creating a Blackjack simulation program to test and compare different strategies. Players can choose from various strategies and play a specified number of games. Additionally, users have the option to play the game themselves in a heads-up match against the dealer, with options to play solo, with other users, or with CPU players using different strategies.

The project includes the following main components:

- **Blackjack Game Logic**: The core game logic of Blackjack, including card dealing, player actions, dealer actions, scoring, and determining the winner.
- **Strategy Implementations**: Implementations of different Blackjack strategies, such as Basic Strategy, card counting, random play, and imitating the dealer.
- **User Gameplay**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to play Blackjack themselves, either in a heads-up match against the dealer or in multiplayer mode with other users and bots.
- **Performance Tracking**: A system to track the performance of each strategy over a specified number of games.
- **Spreadsheet and Graphs (Work In Progress)**: A feature to export strategy performance data to a spreadsheet and plot graphs to visualize the data.
